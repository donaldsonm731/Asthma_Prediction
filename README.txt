# Asthma_Prediction
Predicting the severity of asthma attacks based on a data set with 
ten features(gender, age, outdoor job, outdoor activity, if they smoke, 
humidity, temperature, pressure, UV index and wind speed). In this project 
we aim to go through the data analytics process to come up with a good model 
for predicting asthma attack severity.
