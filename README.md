# Asthma_Prediction
Predicting the severity of asthma attacks based on a data set with ten features(gender, age, outdoor job, outdoor activity, if they smoke, humidity, temperature, pressure, UV index and wind speed). In this project we aim to go through the data analytics process to come up with a good model for predicting asthma attack severity.
